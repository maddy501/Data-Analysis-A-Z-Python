It contains important code snippets for Data Cleaning, Data preprocessing and Data Analysis. Below is the folder hierarchy:

**Data Analysis Folder**:

1-Data Analysis
- Data_Selection_rows_columns.pynb => Contains code snippets on how to select rows and columns value using pandas library from a pandas DataFrame
- Pandas_Visualization.pynb => Contains code snippets on how to use matplot library to plot various graphs
- Pandas_aggregatingfunction.pynb => Contains code snippets to perform aggregation operation on pandas dataframe such as max,min,count,sum,value_counts
-Principle_Component_Analysis.pynb => Contains code snippets to perform PCA to perform dimensionality reduction.

2-Data Wrangling
- Data_cleaning_1 => Contains code snippets for String Processing || Data Type Conversion || Aggregation
- Data_cleaning_2 => Contains code snippets for Filtering || Removing Missing Data

3-Data Analysis Project:
- Exploring the Data Scientists: This projects involes using python libraries to perform Data Analysis on the Data Scienctist data collected by Kaggel. In 2017, Kaggle (a data science community and competition platform) conducted a survey on a large range of users registered as the data scientist in their platform. The survey data are broadly covered the skill set of the data scientists, the demographic of the data scientists, the feedback of the platform and many other information.This project involved
- dealing with missing values in the dataset
- Performing Calculation among the DataFrame columns
- merging two excel dataframes using pandas
- Outlier Detection using boxplot
- Finding Data Statistics
- Plotting Stacked and simple bar graph 
- Performing tokenize on text column to find the most common words that in jobs posted for data scientists.
